# Welcome!

>SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices will be run virtually from October 18-22, 2021. 
<!-- Click **[here](TBD)** to join our Zoom call. -->

SciTinyML is an ICTP Virtual Meeting for the [TinyML4D Academic Network](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/4D/AcademicNetwork).

tinyML enables machine learning technologies to perform on-device analytics of sensor data at extremely low power. This allows for new scientific applications to be developed at an extremely low cost and at large scale.
 
In recent years, hardware advancements have made it possible for microcontrollers to perform calculations much faster. Improved hardware has made it easier for developers to build programs on these devices. Perhaps the most important trend for scientists has been the rise of tiny machine learning, or tinyML.
 
Between hardware advancements and the tinyML community’s recent innovations in machine learning, it is now possible to run increasingly complex deep learning models directly on microcontrollers. tinyML represents a collaborative eﬀort between the embedded power systems and machine learning communities, which traditionally have operated independently.
 
Topics:
+ Introduction to (tiny) ML
+ Examples of tinyML applications
+ Scientific Applications of ML
